# Branch-and-Bound-FSP
This repository contains an implementation of the Branch and Bound algorithm to solve the Flow Shop Scheduling Problem (FSP). The Flow Shop Scheduling Problem is a classic optimization problem in operations research, where the goal is to determine the optimal sequence of jobs on multiple machines to minimize the total completion time (makespan).
